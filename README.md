# PyCity Schools Analysis

Project description:

The following analysis pertains to the collection of size, type and amount of spending of schools in a certain district and compares them to their students’ testing results. The district’s overall key metrics were collected and each individual school’s key metrics were subsequently collected. From this, the highest and lowest performing schools were determined as well as each grade’s average math and reading performances from each school. Finally, scores were sorted by school spending, school size, and school type.
